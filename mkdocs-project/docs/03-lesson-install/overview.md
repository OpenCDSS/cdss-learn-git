Git client software is available as various software tools on various platforms.
Multiple tools can be installed and configured, depending on the development environment.
For example, command-line Git tools are often handy for manual Git operations from a terminal,
whereas a graphical tool may be helpful for understanding branches and merging.

This training documentation focuses on command line tools because they provide the most direct
understanding of how Git works.
