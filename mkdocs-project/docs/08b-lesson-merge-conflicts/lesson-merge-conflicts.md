# Learn Git / Merge Conflicts #

This lesson focuses on how to deal with merge conflicts.

**This lesson is incomplete.**

Merge conflicts arise when two developers have edited the same code and Git software
cannot determine how to resolve the conflicts.
Note that merge conflicts have nothing to do with whether the result validates.
Merged files must be validated using tests before the result can be published.

More information will be included later to discuss how to deal with merge conflicts using CDSS examples.
