# Learn Git / Pull Requests #

This lesson explains basic use of pull requests.

**This lesson is incomplete.**

Pull requests will be used in OpenCDSS projects to accept contributions from third parties.
Pull requests can also be used for internal contributions.
However, because the number of internal contributors is expected to be small,
direct interaction with the repository will likely occur.

More information will be added later about pull requests.
